# Personalized Perfume Quiz  
_Are you struggling to finding your own personalized scent? If so, this quiz is perfect for you!_

_This quiz aims to help those who want to purchase perfumes, but don’t know which scent to get or which suits them the best, to find their perfect, unique scent._


## Overview  

I personally really love perfume and learning about each of the 3 scent levels, various types of scents, and the bottle packaging as well.
However, I feel like it’s hard for many people when it comes to choosing which type of perfume to get because there are so many variations and types. 
Therefore, I created this fun, short, quiz that helps people to understand the best perfume scent for them. I have broken down each scent by the 3 distinct levels: top, middle, and bottom notes. 
There is also 2 distinct scent profiles that visually illustrates each perfume, along with 2 existing perfume reccomendations based on the result.

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | What I Tried | Final Solution |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| How to account for all 3 levels of scent notes | previously had 3x3x3 = 27 different results | changed to 2x2x2 = 8 results |
| How to split each question to match eac | Tried DOM animation | Switched to canvas and throttling |


## Next Steps & Future Advancements

If given more time, here’s what I would improve or add:
- More interactivity with user input (matching puzzles, dragging divs)
- moving gifs or animations to make the quiz more intriguing and fun
- moving images of the perfume bottles
