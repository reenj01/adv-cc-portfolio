      <h2>Favorite Hobby</h2>
      <p>My favorite thing to do is snowboarding, so each year I only wait for winter to come and to be able to go down the snowy mountain slopes. I would also say that I love anything similar or related to snowboarding, such as surfing, wakeboarding, skateboarding and sandboarding. I guess I have something for those types of activities.</p>

      <h2>Personal Motivation</h2>
      <p>One personal motivation or belief that I keep close to myself is to not waste time. The biggest regret that I have as an 18 year old person living in this world is the fact that looking back at my past, I used time extremely inefficiently and ineffectively. There are so many moments in the past where I want to really tell my past self to realize that time flows in the same speed for every single person in the world, but it is up to me to decide how I will use the time wisely. I saw how I lazy I was, using the time to be on my phone all the time, and pushing back the work that I had to do. However, I can't say that I have fully been taking action about this because I still find myself reaching for my phone or doing something that distracts me from getting things done and using that time to further improve myself.</p>
